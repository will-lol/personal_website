      # No tag is provided in the Nix build configuration for our Docker image.
      # When no tag is provided, Nix generates one for you based on the contents
      # of the build inputs. This ensures that the image tag changes any time
      # any aspect of the build changes (even one character in one file). In
      # this CI step, the image is loaded, the image tag is inferred from the
      # build output, and then that tag is saved to the CI environment under the
      # IMAGE_TAG environment variable (used later during deployment).
